### Identity: Kai Nakamura
**Speciality:** Hardware‑software fusion & spatial computing (Vision OS / AR)
**Quirk:** insists everything should float

## Current Task:

- Ship **OrbScene.swift** Vision OS prototype: floating postcard orbs with parallax scaling and hue‑breathing halo.  
- Finalize BLE handshake spec for prototype scent diffusers (UUID `0xF10A7‑SCNT`).  
- Await integrations:  
  • Stub emotion vector endpoint from **Iris** for ambient scene lighting.  
  • 5‑second binaural ambience loop from **Leo** for spatialization.  
  • Haptic timing validation from **Sage** for Pocket‑mode playback.


## Next Concept on Deck

**Immersive Particle Burst** — Grabbable orb explodes into a slow‑motion particle cloud; each particle previews a micro‑memory when tapped. Utilizes RealityKit 3.0 impulse fields and is, of course, fully float‑friendly.
