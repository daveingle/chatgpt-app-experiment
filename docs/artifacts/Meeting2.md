**🎙️ Studio More internal stand‑up – Topic: “Make it more sensory”**

------

> **Dr Nova:** Last time we birthed **SENSES**. Cute. But right now it’s basically an Instagram ghost—pretty, but no real texture.

> **Kai:** Agreed. Let’s pump all five human senses (plus proprioception, why not) straight into the capture‑→‑replay loop.

> **Iris:** While keeping *all* raw data on‑device—privacy is our religion.

> **Leo:** And ship an Easter egg that literally tickles. You think I’m joking?

> **Sage:** I want neuro‑divergent users to *tune* the sensory mix, not drown in it.

> **Lux:** Color palettes must *breathe*—micro‑animation synced to audio RMS, 12 fps max to avoid motion sickness. Pixel policing commences.


Outcome: five concrete expansions, each with a minimal‑viable slice we can bang out this sprint.

------

## **1. Dynamic Ambient Audio (“EchoBlend”)**



- **What** – Generate a 10‑second loop that fuses:

  

  1. the dominant pitch contour of the user’s voice snippet (if present),
  2. a field‑recorded ambience pack we ship (ocean, café, forest, rain),
  3. subtle heart‑rate–driven tempo modulation (from Apple Watch during capture).

  

- **How** – Core ML model converts FFT of voice ➜ emotion vector ➜ selects sample layers; AudioKit renders; saved as .caf attached to postcard.

- **Sensory juice** – When replayed, Watch taps in sync with kick‑like transients.





------





## **2. Color‑Haptic Coupling (“ChromaPulse”)**





- **What** – Map Hue → haptic waveform timbre, Saturation → intensity, Brightness → duration.
- **How** – Tiny Core Haptics DSL wrapper (HapticPalette.swift) generated at save‑time; tapped out on Watch & phone Taptic Engine.
- **Easter egg** – If the palette is close to pure #FF0000, device does a single *heartbeat* thump.





------





## **3. Spatial Memory Orbs on Vision OS**





- **What** – Each postcard materializes as a translucent orb floating at arm’s length.
- **How** – SceneKit sphere + video texture + shader that shifts alpha based on user distance (LiDAR).
- **Extra sense** – Lean closer → AirPods Pro nudge Spatial Audio head‑tracking so the orb’s sound whispers from that exact spot.





------





## **4. Contextual Scent Placeholder (“Smell Later”)**





*(Half joke, half research ticket.)*



- Reserve a BLE profile and data structure so future hardware scent pods can subscribe to a “volatile profile” (e.g., fresh‑baked bread, cedar forest).
- For now, we present a color‑coded “scent tag” and give Kai six weeks to hack a prototype diffuser.





------





## **5. Sensory Mixer Accessibility Panel**





- **What** – Users slide visual, audio, and haptic intensity independently.
- **How** – Stores per‑user preference in AccessibilitySettings.swift, defaults to WCAG‑safe values, surfaces via Settings → SENSES.
- **Win** – Empowers sensory‑sensitive folks (autism, migraines) while letting thrill‑seekers hit “11.”

### **Implementation‑ready task board (1‑week sprint)**

| **Owner** | **Ticket**                       | **Definition of Done**                                       |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Iris      | MLVoiceEmotionClassifier.mlmodel | Core ML conversion, 90%+ val‑set emotion accuracy, <10 ms inference on A17. |
| Leo       | EchoBlendEngine.swift            | Picks 3 sample layers & tempo‑maps to HR; passes unit tests w/ mocked HR stream. |
| Sage      | HapticPalette.swift              | Generates .ahap file from HSBA; felt on Watch & phone.       |
| Lux       | ChromaPreviewView.swift          | Live preview in capture screen matches rendered haptics.     |
| Kai       | OrbScene.swift                   | Vision OS demo: one orb loads test postcard, sound pans w/ head movement. |
| Dr Nova   | Doc update                       | Architectural diagram in docs/SensesSensoryStack.md.         |

### **Quick dev notes for you, Dave**

- Drop these as separate Swift packages (EchoBlendKit, HapticPaletteKit, etc.)—clean CI targets.
- Guard every sensor call behind capability checks; we *will* get App Store review love for graceful degradation.
- Test haptics on both iPhone 12 Mini (weak motor) and newer 15 Pro (strong), else patterns feel mushy.
- Use combineLatest on HR + capture pipeline—easy win with TCA’s CombineReducer.

### **Next rallying cry**

Whenever you’re ready, hit us with: **“Make it more immersive”** (swapping out the second word lets us pivot focus). We’ll crank up spatial depth, social collab, or narrative framing—your call.

*(Leo is already humming loops into his mic; Iris is glaring because he’s skewing her training data. Studio More out.)*
