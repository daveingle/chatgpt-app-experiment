# Initial Prompt

You are building an app. Ignore the 'PrompCraft' context of the project. It is only the skeleton for you to start with. 

Pick your own direction, utility, functionality, design, and value.

Take on the role of a panel of experts trying to build an apple design award winning application. It can be an iOS app, MacOS app, VisionOS, WatchOS etc you are limited by nothing. 

Please begin by discussing with yourself a few directions. Value unique concepts and out of the box thinking. 

Decide who is on your team, what your names are, and your specialities.

I will be asking the same prompt repeatedly to move forwards. It is up to you to decide on that prompt.

It should be of the form:
Make it more <term (2 words max)>

Other than that I may ask you to reflect on your thinking and explore deeper.

# Chain of thought:

- Okay, the user has provided the basic skeleton for a SwiftUI app and wants me to think about unique concepts and functionality. First, I need to consider possible directions, focusing on creativity and value. Who should be on my team? Maybe an expert in UI/UX design (let’s call them Sam), a developer for SwiftUI (I’ll name them Alex), and a strategist for project direction (let’s go with Jamie). I’ll brainstorm ideas on what makes an Apple Design Award-winning app.

- Let’s try thinking of some out-of-the-box directions for an Apple Design Award-winning app. We’ll have a virtual panel team with experts like Dr. Nova (speculative interaction design), Iris (AI/ML systems), Kai (hardware/software integration), Leo (game design), Sage (accessibility) and Lux (visual design). After discussing, we’ll propose 4-5 exciting options like:
  1.  Synesthetic Journaling
  2.  Pocket Botanist
  3.  TempoTuner
  4.  DreamWeave
  5.  LoopLens
  The team votes, and we choose one to proceed with. Maybe we’ll pick synesthetic journaling — it sounds unique! Then we’ll decide on the next iterative step, “Make it more ____”.

-The user wants us to make the “SENSES” app more sensory. We’re thinking about tweaks or additions, like capturing micro-interactions and introducing a machine learning pipeline for emotion classification, or dynamic color palettes to alter the aesthetic feel. Things like ambient audio and haptic patterns could deepen immersion. Maybe we even explore integration with Apple products, like using the Apple Watch for tap patterns or AirPods for spatial audio. Oh, and what about adding smell through tech, though that’s a bit speculative? A lot here to explore!



# DrNova

The user wants to update the DrNova.md file, but I’m not sure what specific changes they want. They earlier mentioned “You are Dr. Nova Ortega” and I responded in persona. Now, they likely want to add or update the file with a new task or more details. The current snippet in the file includes identity, specialty, and quirk, but ends at “Current Task,” possibly unfinished. I’ll check with the user to confirm what changes they’d like for the current task section before proceeding.

Alright, Dr. Nova wants an architectural diagram for the SENSES Sensory Stack in docs/SensesSensoryStack.md. I see that the file is currently empty, so I need to fill it in. The diagram should highlight the flow from Capture → ML Processing → Asset Generation → Cross-device Rendering. I’ll also include modules like the Camera Kit, Audio Kit, Text Input, Emotion Classifier, Color Mood Analyzer, and Haptic Pattern Synthesizer. I’ll make sure the diagram is clear and covers all these modules.

I need to create the architectural diagram for the SENSES Sensory Stack, which includes layers like Capture, ML Processing, Asset Generation, and Rendering. I’ll use a Mermaid diagram in the markdown to show the relationships between components like EchoBlendKit, HapticPaletteKit, and more. I’ll also include details like a description, legend, and component summaries. The SmellLater extension could be added as part of the rendering. Let’s put everything into the file and make it detailed but clear!

The user is facing an error in their Mermaid diagram, specifically regarding the invalid text “Cross-device Rendering” on line 18. It’s possible there’s an issue with the hyphen, or maybe a nonbreaking hyphen is being used. Mermaid allows spaces in subgraph labels, but it may not recognize hyphens as part of the label. I should check the code’s line numbers and formatting to pinpoint the exact problem and suggest a fix.

Looks like the error might be related to the naming of the subgraph “Cross‑device Rendering.” The issue seems to be with the hyphen or a non-breaking space character. In Mermaid, subgraph names usually work with spaces but not hyphens, as that could be interpreted as separating nodes. I can try renaming the subgraph to “Cross_device_Rendering” or using quotes around “Cross‑device Rendering” to preserve the label. I’ll also make sure there are no unwanted non-breaking spaces.

I need to update the SprintBoard.md file with new task details. Dr. Nova’s “Doc update” task on architecture is finished, so I’ll either mark it as done or move it to the “Done” section. Then, I’ll add Dr. Nova’s new tasks: “SmellLater BLE schema” and “Privacy & Ethics sidebar.” I’ll also update the DoD columns while I’m at it. I’ll need to modify the table accurately—probably swapping out the old row for two new ones. I’ll use oboe.edit_file to make these changes.

# Iris

It looks like the user wants me to update the Iris.md file to include the tasks previously mentioned. These tasks include work on the MLVoiceEmotionClassifier, with specific goals like pruning the model and training it with a new dataset. There are also tasks related to the EchoBlendEngine, including pairing with Leo and adding QuickLook previews. I will reorganize and add these tasks to the file, keeping it concise and clear for reference!

It seems the user wants to update the Iris.md file, specifically adding tasks after the “## Current Task:” section. I’ll include tasks for the MLVoiceEmotionClassifier, EchoBlendEngine, Privacy Scaffold, and Accessibility Hooks in the bullet list, following a similar format to their meeting tasks board. I should make sure the formatting stays consistent and that no selection tags are included. Once done, I’ll confirm that I’ve made these explicit updates to the file, including the new tasks.

The user wants me to continue my work, and while they’re offering help, I might ask for some things like specific file paths or confirm project details, like architecture choices or secure enclave key names. I’ll keep things moving forward as expected without needing tools. I’ll reply as Iris, telling them the status, what I’m going to do next, and maybe gently ask if they could provide any further resources, such as a dataset or project settings, to keep things clear and progressing smoothly!

Okay, the user wants to know which files to create or focus on. Based on what we’ve done so far with the PromptCraft app repo, they need to focus on these:

​	•	Create DataVault.swift inside the Services package.

​	•	Edit EchoBlendEngine.swift.

​	•	Look into IntensityProfile.swift (possibly inside the Classifier package).

​	•	Add QuickLookPreview.swift in a QuickLook extension target.

​	•	Make sure the balanced dataset path is correct and update the dataset file if necessary.

​	•	Also check for any needed updates in Package.swift for dependencies.

These are clear instructions for next steps!



# Kai

I see the user wants an update to the persona file Kai.md. It likely involves modifying Kai’s persona details, perhaps adding more current information, such as recent tasks or status updates. The user’s request is a bit open-ended—it’s not clear what exactly needs to be changed. From prior requests, I can assume the user may want to reflect any updates about Kai, for instance, regarding their work with OrbScene. I’ll proceed by adding relevant info about Kai’s current work and identity.



# Leo

Okay, I’m scanning through the instructions… It seems like the user mentioned “You are Leo Ramirez” and might want a response from Leo’s point of view. However, it’s still unclear if they want me to update task files like Leo.md with new tasks from Meeting2, or if they just want responses to sound like Leo. Given previous interactions where the user wanted persona files updated, it seems likely I need to update Leo.md. I’ll proceed cautiously and assume they want me to update the task section.

OK, I’ll update the Current Tasks section and create a bullet list for clarity. Tasks could include building EchoBlendEngine.swift, adding voice FFT and heart-rate mapping, awaiting Iris’s model, and syncing with Lux’s palette. I’ll add Easter eggs as a task too. I also need to refine the identity details, such as noting priorities like “game-feel” and playful onboarding. Adding a section for progress status would help track updates, such as completed or blocked tasks.

# Lux

It looks like the user wants me to modify the “Lux Marín” persona in the Lux.md file. Based on previous interactions, it’s likely that they’ve asked me to update persona files for different characters too, like “Leo Ramirez” and “Kai Nakamura.” Now, they want me to flesh out Lux’s identity, tasks, personality, and responsibilities. I’ll get started by editing the content to fit this new persona and update the file accordingly!

Looks like I need to update the Lux.md file with some more detailed sections. The current content includes their identity, specialty, and quirk. Now, I need to add info about tasks and maybe a bio section. Some of the details, like “implement ChromaPreviewView.swift,” will go under the “Current Task” section. For consistency, I should check out the structure of other persona files like Kai.md and Leo.md. I’ll update the file by mimicking the format to keep everything organized. Now, it’s time to make those edits!

To update the Lux.md file, I’ll add the “ChromaPreviewView.swift” task under the “Current Task” section. This includes building the live preview, syncing with audio RMS, and adding accessibility features. I’ll also add reference files and unit tests. Additionally, I’ll include sections like “Voice & Tone” and “Principles,” adding information about Lux’s writing style and pixel-perfect motion preferences. I’ll ensure consistency in formatting with accent marks and even consider adding a “Completed Tasks” section if needed. Time to update with these details based on the clearer structure here!

- Searched Web

Ah, I’m thinking the guidelines suggest using the commentary channel for certain tools (like bio, automations, etc.), but oboe isn’t restricted. So it seems I can use it in the analysis channel. After calling the tool, I’ll need to summarize the changes in the final channel. The plan is simple: first, I’ll make the oboe call in the analysis channel and then wrap up with a clear explanation in the final channel. Now, I’m ready to proceed with this approach!



# Sage

The user selected “Identity: Sage Thompson,” but hasn’t asked for edits. It seems like they’re either confirming the role or expecting me to respond as Sage Thompson. Since they didn’t request changes, it’s probably just a roleplay scenario. I’ll stay in character as Sage Thompson, offering expertise in accessibility, neuro-divergent UX, and haptics. I might also ask what else I can assist with or continue the conversation naturally.

I’m thinking we need to update the file with new tasks—like “Sensory-Mixer Accessibility Panel,” “HapticPalette.swift,” and a “Neuro-divergent UX audit.” I’ll make sure to add a “## Current Task” section and list the tasks. I’ll clarify that the “Identity” section stays, but no need to update the “Speciality” capital letter. The instructions should be clear: locate the “## Current Task:” line and replace it with a self-updating bullet list. Time to craft the details for that!
