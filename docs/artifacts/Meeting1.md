# 👥 Assembled “Studio More” Panel

| **Name**           | **Specialty**                                                | **Quirk**                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dr Nova Ortega** | Speculative interaction design & future‑casting              | doodles impossible UI widgets on napkins         |
| **Kai Nakamura**   | Hardware‑software fusion & spatial computing (Vision OS / AR) | insists everything should float                  |
| **Iris Zhang**     | On‑device AI/ML & personal‑data privacy                      | speaks only in metaphors before coffee           |
| **Leo Ramirez**    | Game‑feel, playful onboarding, subtle dopamine loops         | refuses to ship anything without an Easter egg   |
| **Sage Thompson**  | Accessibility, neuro‑divergent UX, haptics                   | owns 27 different canes to test tactile feedback |
| **Lux Marín**      | Motion graphics, typography, brand aura                      | can spot a mis‑aligned pixel at 3 m              |



## **🔭 Five moon‑shot directions we just argued about**

| **Codename**            | **60‑second pitch**                                          | **“Apple Design Award‑ness” hook**                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Synesthetic Journal** | Capture a daily moment (photo/audio/short text). On‑device ML turns it into a multi‑sensory postcard: color palette, ambient sound remix, subtle haptic loop. Vision OS replays it as a living diorama. | Emotionally resonant, private by default, cross‑device (iPhone‑watch‑Vision), leverages Neural Engine for style transfer. |
| **Pocket Botanist**     | Point camera at any urban space. App proposes micro‑greening layouts (planters, moss walls) in AR, factoring local climate. Watch reminds you to water, Vision OS shows future growth. | Climate action meets delightful AR, uses LiDAR & HealthKit “green credits”. |
| **TempoTuner**          | Your watch reads heart rate / HRV; app generates adaptive soundscapes and ambient UI tempo. Helps focus or calm. Vision OS projects subtle visuals into peripheral vision; Mac app throttles notifications when focus score peaks. | Whole‑ecosystem bio‑adaptive UX; accessibility win for ADHD/anxiety. |
| **DreamWeave**          | Multiplayer mixed‑reality “loom.” Each person sketches 3‑D strokes in space; app weaves them into generative fabrics you can drape over real objects. | Social presence + literal touchable art; Shine ToolKit + Metal for cloth sim. |
| **LoopLens**            | Stand at any landmark, swipe back in time with historical AR layers stitched to precise POV using Apple Maps Look Around & Core Location Elevation. Users can record “time sandwiches” that blend eras. | Goose‑bump factor; pushes camera calibration & MapKit JS to new limits. |



## **🗳 Lightning debate & decision**

- **Kai** loves DreamWeave (“Reality Composer on spice!”) but concedes cloth sim might blow the schedule.
- **Iris** wants private, on‑device ML → votes Synesthetic Journal.
- **Sage** notes journaling can be huge for neuro‑divergent users.
- **Lux** sees endless palette animation possibilities.
- **Leo**: “We can gamify consistency with gentle streak gardens.”
- **Dr Nova** bangs gavel → **Synesthetic Journal wins**.



## **🎯 Working title:** 

“SENSES”  > Your memories, felt—not just viewed.

**Core loop**

1. **Grab** a quick capture (photo or 3‑sec video, voice snippet, or text).
2. **Blend**: On‑device model maps emotional tone → generates color wash, ambient audio filter, micro‑haptic pulse.
3. **Relive**: iPhone shows living postcard; Watch taps pattern; Vision OS places it in spatial album.
4. **Grow**: Streak garden blossoms with hues from your days.



## **🚀 Our perpetual prompt for iteration**

Make it more sensory

Two words, broad enough to push visuals, sound, haptics, even smell (Kai already ordered prototype scent diffusers 🙄).

Every time you feed us that line, we’ll choose a facet—UX flow, ML model, motion, monetization—and turn the dial up.
