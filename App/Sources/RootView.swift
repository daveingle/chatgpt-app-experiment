# Day 1 – Assembling the Studio & Picking a Direction

### Studio More Stand‑up (Full Transcript)

```
🎙️ Studio More internal stand‑up – Topic: “Make it more sensory”

Leo: Okay team, we’ve got the initial app concept nailed down: a Synesthetic Journal that blends sound, color, and touch. But how do we make it truly sensory?

Iris: We should integrate emotion detection from voice input to modulate the ambient audio layers. That way, the journal entries feel alive.

Sage: I can work on generating haptic patterns that sync with the audio and visuals. Imagine a soft pulse that matches a heartbeat or a gentle shimmer that corresponds with color changes.

Lux: Visuals should react dynamically. Maybe a color palette that shifts based on the user’s mood or the time of day.

Kai: For Vision OS, we can create spatial orbs that represent different sensory inputs. Users can interact with them in 3D space.

Dr Nova: Don’t forget accessibility. We need sliders or controls that let users adjust the intensity of each sensory channel.

Leo: Great points. Let’s anchor our iteration loop around the prompt “Make it more sensory.” Everyone, focus your tasks on that.

Iris: I’ll start training the voice emotion classifier model with new datasets.

Sage: Haptic patterns coming up, tuned for both Watch and phone.

Lux: I’ll prototype the color-haptic sync previews.

Kai: Working on the Vision OS orb scene with spatial audio.

Dr Nova: I’ll update the docs with the architecture diagram reflecting these sensory layers.

(Leo is already humming loops into his mic; Iris is glaring because he’s skewing her training data. Studio More out.)

# Day 1 – Studio More Stand‑up Summary

**Topic:** “Make it more sensory”

## Key Decisions
- Focus app direction on a *Synesthetic Journal* now branded **SENSES**.
- Anchor iteration loop around the prompt **“Make it more sensory.”**

## Expansions Approved for Sprint 1
1. **EchoBlend** – Emotion‑driven ambient audio loop with Watch haptic sync.  
2. **ChromaPulse** – Color → haptic waveform mapping with heartbeat Easter egg.  
3. **Spatial Memory Orbs** – Vision OS representation with spatial audio panning.  
4. **SmellLater** – Placeholder BLE scent profile for future hardware pods.  
5. **Sensory Mixer Panel** – Accessibility sliders to tune visual/audio/haptic intensity.
