# Day 1 – Assembling the Studio & Picking a Direction

## 💬 ChatGPT Response(s)

### Studio More Stand‑up (Full Transcript)

```
🎙️ Studio More internal stand‑up – Topic: “Make it more sensory”

Leo: Alright team, let’s dive in. The prompt is clear: “Make it more sensory.” Thoughts?

Iris: From a machine learning perspective, we can enhance the emotional detection accuracy by incorporating multi-modal inputs—voice tone, facial expression, and even ambient context.

Sage: I like that. On the haptic side, we could design layered feedback patterns that correspond to different emotional intensities detected by Iris’s models.

Lux: Visuals should complement that. Maybe color pulses or gradients that shift with the emotional state, synced to the haptic feedback.

Kai: For Vision OS, spatial audio could help create a more immersive environment. Imagine orbs that emit sounds and haptics as you move around them.

Dr Nova: Let’s also consider accessibility. We want this to be inclusive, so adjustable intensity sliders for visuals, audio, and haptics might be necessary.

Leo: Great points all around. Iris, can you prototype the multi-modal emotion classifier?

Iris: On it. I’ll start with voice and facial data, then integrate context cues.

Sage: I’ll work on the haptic layering engine, ensuring it can handle real-time input from Iris’s model.

Lux: I’ll create a prototype for the color pulse visuals and sync it with Sage’s haptics.

Kai: I’ll begin designing the spatial audio orb scene for Vision OS.

Dr Nova: I’ll draft the accessibility settings and documentation.

Leo: Perfect. Let’s check in tomorrow with progress updates. Studio More out.

(Leo is already humming loops into his mic; Iris is glaring because he’s skewing her training data. Studio More out.)
