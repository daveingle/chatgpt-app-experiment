<file name=logs/Day2.md># Day 2 – Flattening the Cast

## 🗓️ Date
May 14, 2025

## 🔥 Summary
Consolidated **all persona files** into a single `personas.md` to cut down on file‑hopping overhead. Set up Day 2 log and synced the sprint board.
Instituted a “design‑first” rule—every feature now requires a diagram brief before coding. Added a reusable template and updated the sprint board accordingly.
- Introduced *Feature‑Plan* workflow — every major capability now starts with a markdown spec stored in `docs/architecture/feature-plans/` (EchoBlend, HapticPalette, Orb, ChromaPreview seeded).

## 🤖 Prompt(s)
> Asked each agent to: "Please update your feature plan document, include mermaid diagrams if needed and break it down into granular task that we can groom/estimate"

> Welcome to meeting three Iris, Leo, Sage, Lux, Kai and Dr Nova. Please review Meeting 1 and 2 then hold meeting 3.
After that is done your Prompt for the app design and strategy is:
"Make it more immersive"

> Okay given meeting 3 please update the Day2_Standup_Summary

> Please update Day2.md, include the shift to feature-plans etc. Then Update the README to reflect the current state of the project

- [x] Reviewed sprint board for any broken links after flattening
- [x] Confirmed Mermaid diagram renders after recent label fix
- [x] Added `/docs/DiagramRequestTemplate.md`
- [x] Inserted “Ready ⇢ Diagram OK” column in `SprintBoard.md`
- [ ] Pinged owners to attach diagram briefs to their tickets
- [x] Created `docs/architecture/feature-plans/` and four initial feature plan docs
- [x] Wired sprint board tickets to their respective Feature‑Plan links

## 🚧 Challenges or Oddities
- Team started implementing features without upstream diagrams—needed a process fix.

## 🧠 Reflection

Flattening personas felt good, but highlighted the cost of scattered docs. The new diagram‑first gate should curb that drift and keep everyone aligned. The dedicated Feature‑Plan docs already feel like a single source of truth for design discussions.

## 🔮 Tomorrow

Leave this blank until the *end* of tomorrow’s session. Then summarize what was accomplished and set a soft direction for the next day.
