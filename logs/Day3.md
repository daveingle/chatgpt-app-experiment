<file name=logs/Day2.md># Day 2 – Flattening the Cast

## 🗓️ Date
May 14, 2025

## 🔥 Summary
Consolidated **all persona files** into a single `personas.md` to cut down on file‑hopping overhead. Set up Day 2 log and synced the sprint board.
Instituted a “design‑first” rule—every feature now requires a diagram brief before coding. Added a reusable template and updated the sprint board accordingly.
- Introduced *Feature‑Plan* workflow — every major capability now starts with a markdown spec stored in `docs/architecture/feature-plans/` (EchoBlend, HapticPalette, Orb, ChromaPreview seeded).

## 🤖 Prompt(s)
> Asked each agent to: "Please update your feature plan document, include mermaid diagrams if needed and break it down into granular task that we can groom/estimate"

> Welcome to meeting three Iris, Leo, Sage, Lux, Kai and Dr Nova. Please review Meeting 1 and 2 then hold meeting 3.
After that is done your Prompt for the app design and strategy is:
"Make it more immersive"

> Okay given meeting 3 please update the Day2_Standup_Summary

> Please update Day2.md, include the shift to feature-plans etc. Then Update the README to reflect the current state of the project

Paste the most relevant responses here (code or explanation).  
Keep it short and focused—this isn’t meant to be a full dump unless it’s useful to preserve the whole thing.

## 🛠️ What I Built
- [x] Merged individual persona docs into `personas.md`
- [x] Reviewed sprint board for any broken links after flattening
- [x] Confirmed Mermaid diagram renders after recent label fix
- [x] Added `/docs/DiagramRequestTemplate.md`
- [x] Inserted “Ready ⇢ Diagram OK” column in `SprintBoard.md`
- [ ] Pinged owners to attach diagram briefs to their tickets
- [x] Created `docs/architecture/feature-plans/` and four initial feature plan docs
- [x] Wired sprint board tickets to their respective Feature‑Plan links

## 🚧 Challenges or Oddities
- Team started implementing features without upstream diagrams—needed a process fix.

## 🧠 Reflection

Flattening personas felt good, but highlighted the cost of scattered docs. The new diagram‑first gate should curb that drift and keep everyone aligned. The dedicated Feature‑Plan docs already feel like a single source of truth for design discussions.

## 🔮 Tomorrow

Leave this blank until the *end* of tomorrow’s session. Then summarize what was accomplished and set a soft direction for the next day.

# Day 3 – Service Split & PaletteExtractor Prototype

## 🗓️ Date
May 15, 2025

## 🔥 Summary
Converted the monolithic *Services* umbrella into **stand‑alone packages** and delivered the first functional module:  
**`PaletteExtractor`** – a Core Image/SwiftUI utility that returns weighted dominant‑color swatches from a `CVPixelBuffer`.

Additional housekeeping:
- Hardened `snapshot.sh` with null‑delimited `git ls-files` and smarter filters.
- Added `changelog.sh` fallback when no tags exist.
- Ignored `logs/changes/` and `logs/workspace.md` in `.gitignore`.

## 🤖 Prompt(s)
> *“Should I switch from umbrella packages to single library packages?”*  
> *“Please suggest platform changes per package.”*  
> *“Can you add the logs/changes dir and logs/workspace.md to gitignore?”*

## 💬 ChatGPT Response(s)
- Recommended splitting any platform‑exclusive code (e.g. VisionOS orb) into its own SwiftPM package to avoid broad platform clauses.
- Provided per‑package `platforms` matrix:  
  - DataVault → iOS 15 / macOS 12 / watchOS 8  
  - EchoBlendKit → iOS 17 / watchOS 10  
  - VisionOrbKit → visionOS 1 only, etc.
- Supplied commit messages for refactor and gitignore tweaks.
- Supplied improved snapshot & changelog scripts.

## 🛠️ What I Built
- [x] **Packages/Services/PaletteExtractor** (`Package.swift`, source & unit tests)
- [x] Implemented `PaletteExtractor.process(_:)` with a simple average‑color fallback.
- [x] Added `PaletteExtractorTests` using `Testing` DSL.
- [x] Split Services umbrella; removed old manifest.
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to exclude snapshot/diff artefacts.
- [x] Patched `snapshot.sh` for null‑safe file iteration.
- [x] Patched `changelog.sh` with tag‑fallback logic.
- [x] Generated & committed `logs/changes/2025‑05‑15_diff.md`.
- [ ] TODO: Apply per‑package `platforms` clauses (next task).

## 📸 Screenshot(s)

*(Add any relevant screenshots here once captured.)*

## 🚧 Challenges or Oddities
- `changelog.sh` failed initially because there were **no tags**; fixed via tag‑fallback logic.
- Wildcard path in the old snapshot script expanded to `<user_selection>` placeholders; now resolved with `git ls-files -z`.
- XCTest needed a small extension to create dummy `CVPixelBuffer`s; added helper in tests.

## 🧠 Reflection
Breaking the umbrella package felt like overhead at first, but compiling only the packages that apply to the selected simulator already shaved ~8 seconds off a clean build.  
`PaletteExtractor` is intentionally naïve today—CIKMeans extraction will replace the average‑color stub once Core Image bridging is tuned.

## 🔮 Tomorrow
- Narrow `platforms` stanza for each package per the matrix.
- Create skeleton targets for `EchoBlendKit` and `HapticPaletteKit`.
- Flesh out a first UI spike that shows a live palette preview in the capture screen using mocked pixel buffers.
